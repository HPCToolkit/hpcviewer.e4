/**
The Function interface represents a function that takes a number of inputs
and returns a value.  The number of inputs expected depends on the function.
For example, the PiFunction returns the value of Pi regardless of the input.
The CosFunction uses the value at index location 0.  The PowFunction uses the
values at index locations 0 and 1.  See the FuncMap class for more information.
