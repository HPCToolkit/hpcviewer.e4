<p>VarMap maps a name to a value.  A VarMap is used in the eval method of an Expression object.
This class can be used as the default variable-map.

<p>During the evaluation of an expression, if a variable is not supported then a RuntimeException is thrown.
Case sensitivity can only be specified in the constructor (for consistency).  When case sensitivity is false,
the String.equalsIgnoreCase method is used.  When case sensitivity is true, the String.equals method is used.
By default, case sensitivity is true.
