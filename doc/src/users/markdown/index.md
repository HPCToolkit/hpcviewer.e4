# Overview


HPCToolkit provides the `hpcviewer` ([Adhianto, Mellor-Crummey, and Tallent 2010](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPPW.2010.35); [N. R. Tallent et al. 2011](http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1995896.1995908)) performance presentation tool for interactive examination of performance databases.
`hpcviewer` presents a heterogeneous
calling context tree that spans both CPU and GPU contexts, annotated
with measured or derived metrics to help users assess code performance
and identify bottlenecks.

The database generated by `hpcprof` consists of 4 dimensions: 
- *Execution context* (also called *execution profile*), which includes any logical threads (such as OpenMP, pthread, and C++ threads), MPI processes, and GPU streams.
- *Time*, which represents the timeline of the program's execution. This time dimension is only available if the application is profiled with traces enabled (`hpcrun` `-t` option).
- *Call-path*, which depicts a top-down path in a calling-context tree.
- *Metric*, which constitutes program measurements performed by `hpcrun` such as cycles, number of instructions, stall percentages, and derived metrics such as ratio of idleness.

To simplify performance data visualization, `hpcviewer` restricts
the display of two dimensions at a time: the [*Profile View*](profile.html#sec:profile) displays
pairs of (call-path, metric) or (execution context,
metric) dimensions and the [*Trace View*](trace.html#sec:trace) visualizes the
behavior of execution contexts over time.
The table below summarizes views supported by `hpcviewer`.

| View                  | Dimension                    | Note                                                                |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Profile - [Metric view](profile.html#sec:pane-metric)            | Call-path x Metrics  | display the tree and its associated metrics                         |
| Profile - [Thread view](profile.html#sec:hpcviewer:thread-level) | Call-path x Metrics  | display the tree and its metrics for a set of execution contexts    |
| Profile - [Graph view](profile.html#sec:hpcviewer:plots)         | Execution contexts x Metric | display a metric of a specific tree node for all execution contexts |
| Trace - [Main view](trace.html#sec:mainview)                     | Execution contexts x Time   | display execution context behavior over time                        |
| Trace - [Depth view](trace.html#sec:depthview)    | Call-path x Time     | display call stacks over time of an execution context               |

Note that in the [Profile view](profile.html), GPU stream execution contexts are not shown in this view; metrics for a GPU operation are associated with the calling context in the thread that initiated the GPU operation (Section [Thread View](profile.html#sec:hpcviewer:thread-level)).
In the [Trace view](trace.html), GPU streams have their trace lines independently from their host, allowing for the traces between hosts and devices to be separated.

## Launching

Requirements to launch `hpcviewer`:

- On all platforms: Java 17 or newer (up to Java 21).
- On Linux: GTK 3.20 or newer.

`hpcviewer` can be launched from a command line (Linux platforms) or by clicking the `hpcviewer` icon (for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux platforms).
The command line syntax is as follows:

```
 hpcviewer [options] [<hpctoolkit-database>]
```

Here, `<hpctoolkit-database>` is an optional argument to load a database automatically.
Without this argument, `hpcviewer` will prompt for the location of a database. Possible options for `hpcviewer` are shown below:

`-h, --help`
: Print a help message.

`-jh, --java-heap` *size*
: Set the JVM maximum heap size for this execution of `hpcviewer`. The value of *size* must be in megabytes (M) or gigabytes (G). For example, one can specify a *size* of 3 gigabytes as either 3076M or 3G.

`-v, --version`
: Print the current version

On Linux, when `hpcviewer` is installed using its `install.sh` script, one can specify the maximum size for the Java heap on the current platform. When analyzing measurements for large and complex applications, it may be necessary to use the `--java-heap` option to specify a larger heap size for `hpcviewer` to accommodate many metrics for many contexts.

On macOs and Windows, the value of JVM maximum heap size is stored in `hpcviewer.ini` file, specified with `-Xmx` option.
On macOS, this file is located at `hpcviewer.app/Contents/Eclipse/hpcviewer.ini`.


## Menus

`hpcviewer` provides four main menus: **File**, **Filter**, **View**, and **Help**.

### File

This menu includes several menu items for controlling basic viewer operations.

- **New window**\
  Open a new `hpcviewer` window that is independent of the existing one.
  However, filtering CCT node operation (see [Filtering Tree Nodes](profile.html#sec:filter)) will also affect all `hpcviewer` windows.
- **Open database**\
  Open a database without replacing the existing one. This menu can be used to compare two databases.
- **Open remote database** *(experimental feature)* \
  Open a database located at the remote host via a secured SSH tunnel. One can use the private key option to connect without typing a password.
  See [Remote database](remote.html) page for further details.
- **Switch database** \
  Load a performance database into the current `hpcviewer` window replacing the existing opened databases.
- **Close database** \
  Unloading an open database.
- **Merge databases** \
  Merging two databases that are currently in the viewer.
  Currently, it doesn't support storing a merged database in a file.
    - **Top-down tree**: Merging the top-down tree of the databases.
    - **Flat tree**: Merging the flat (static) tree of the databases.
- **Preferences** \
  Display the settings window, which consists of three sections:
    - **Appearance**: Change the fonts for tree and metric columns and source viewer.
    - **Traces**: Specify settings for Trace view, such as the rendering option, the number of working threads to be used and the tooltip's delay.
    - **Debug**: Enable/disable debug mode and experimental feature.
- **Exit** \
  Quit the `hpcviewer` application.

### Filter

This menu only contains one submenu:

- **Filter CCT nodes** \
  Open a filter property window that lists a set of filters and their properties (Section [Filtering Tree Nodes](profile.html#sec:filter)).
- **Filter execution contexts** (Trace view only) \
  Open a window to hide or show trace lines.

### View

This menu is only visible if at least one database is loaded.

- **Show metrics** *(Profile view only)* \
  Display the list of metrics including their name, description, and visibility. For GPU metrics, the descriptions are useful for explaining what the short and somewhat cryptic metric names mean.
  From this list, one can use the `Edit` button to rename or modify a derived metric, including the formula.
  Once the change is confirmed, it will be propagated to the list and all views (Top-down, Bottom-up, and Flat) in the current database.
- **Show color map** *(Trace view only)* \
  Open a window showing the customized mapping between a procedure pattern and a color. See the [Color map](trace.html#sec:color-map) Section.
- **Debug** *(if the debug mode is enabled)* \
    - **Show database raw's XML**:
    Display of HPCToolkit's raw XML representation for performance data. This menu is only available for old HPCToolkit databases.


### Help

This menu displays information about the viewer. The menu contains only one menu item:

- **About** \
  Displays brief information about the viewer, including JVM and Eclipse variables, and error log files.

## Limitations

Some important `hpcviewer` limitations are listed below:

- **Limited number of metric columns**. \
  With a large number of metric columns, `hpcviewer`'s response time may become sluggish as this requires a large amount of memory.
- **Experimental Windows 11 platform**. \
  The Windows version of `hpcviewer` is mainly tested on Windows 10. Support for Windows 11 is still experimental.
- **No support for dark themes**. \
  We received reports that `hpcviewer` is not very visible on Linux with a dark theme. It is still an ongoing work.
- **Linux TWM window manager is not supported**. \
  Reason: This window manager is too ancient.
